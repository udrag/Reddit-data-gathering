# Reddit data gathering

The following guide will help you set up the Python code for gathering data from Reddit. The code will ask for the user's input on the name of the subreddit post to extract data. Also, the code will ask for the user's input on the number of posts to be included in the data frame.

Please note that in order to get more than 100 posts in your data frame, then the user will need to repeat the process of gathering the data by specifying the oldest post from your initial list. However, not to worry, the code will automate this process and will only need the user's input to continue to add posts to the data frame.
